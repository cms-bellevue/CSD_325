Module 9.2 Assignment â€“ APIs - People In Space
Updated: 2025-04-27

Program Overview:
This program retrieves the current list of astronauts in space from the Open Notify API.
It fetches the data, parses the JSON response, and then displays the total number of
people currently in space along with the name and spacecraft of each individual.

Features & Flow:
- Makes an HTTP GET request to the Open Notify API endpoint for astronauts.
- Handles potential network errors and invalid JSON responses.
- Extracts and prints the count of astronauts.
- Iterates through the list of astronauts and displays their name and associated spacecraft.
- Includes retry logic for handling transient network issues.

Prerequisites:
- Requires the 'requests' Python library.
